The solution involves explicitly resetting potentially inheritable properties within the pseudo-element's declaration.  This prevents any unexpected inheritance from the parent element.

```css
.parent {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  font-size: 24px; /*  Source of the inheritance */
}

.parent::before {
  content: "Hello";
  background-color: lightcoral;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: inherit; /* Or any other potentially problematic inherited properties */
  /* Explicitly reset problematic properties */
}
```

By resetting or explicitly setting inheritable properties within the pseudo-element, we ensure consistent and predictable styling, regardless of the parent's properties.
