The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where a pseudo-element selector (:before or :after) inherits unexpected properties from its parent element, even with explicit styling in the pseudo-element's declaration.

```css
.parent {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  font-size: 24px; /* Unexpected inheritance source */
}

.parent::before {
  content: "Hello";
  background-color: lightcoral;
  font-size: 16px; /* This is overridden */
}
```

In this case, the `font-size` property from the `.parent` element might unexpectedly leak into the pseudo-element even though a `font-size` is explicitly set for `::before`.  This is due to how some browsers handle property inheritance, especially with pseudo-elements. The `font-size` property inherits and causes unexpected behavior in the pseudo-element's styling.
